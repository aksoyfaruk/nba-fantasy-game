# nba-fantasy-game
game that gives people a taste of a superficially enjoyable little NBA simulation


in this game simulation project i have used:
- oop concepts such as: inheritance, type hierarchies, polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces and overloading.
- java collections framework types.
- java swing gui components.
- exception handling and file processing.
